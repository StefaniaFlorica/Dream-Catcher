# Dream-Catcher
React &amp; Java Spring Boot full-stack web application where users can keep track of their dreams. 
The application is able to allow users to input a short description together with a set of tags to add an entry to  application defined category. Once an entry is created the user is able to evaluate the quality of his/her sleep with the following app metrics: duration, energy level, stress. These measurements are recorded on a scale of 1-5 for easy tracking. Given existing data the application is capable of aggregating these metrics across various tag categories and is able to present a daily chart for each quality metric given the user inputs a requested category. The daily chart can be viewed for the current/selected week or the current/selected month.
